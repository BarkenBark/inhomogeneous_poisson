# Learning about inhomogenous poisson processes (IHPP)

The purpose of this project is simply to familiarize myself with the inhomogenous poisson process.

In the end, I want to be able to fit an IHPP to a dataset and be able to validate the model.

To begin with, I'll explore fitting and validation methods of IHPP's to data which I know come from IHPP's by generating IHPP data using simulation.
